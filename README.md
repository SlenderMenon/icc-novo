# Novolytics Assignment

_This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)._

## Introduction

This web project is an assignment for an employment opportunity in Novolytics. The project comprises of a React website, a Node.js backend and a few Shell scripts to facilitate easy setup and execution of the project.

## Pre-requisites

Since this is a web project, you require the following to be installed:
- Node.js
- `npm` package manager

## Let's run!

All steps assume you're on a Linux environment. On some Linux desktop environments like KDE, simply double-tapping the `.sh` files will execute it. In other cases, please open a terminal and do as follows:

- `chmod +x my-favorite-script.sh`
- `./my-favorite-script.sh`

_**Note:** All references to "open a terminal" assume you do so inside the repo directory._

### The Linux way

- If it's the first time you've cloned this repository onto your machine, please execute `setup.sh` which will install `npm` dependencies
- To start the server, please execute `run-server.sh`
- To start the web front-end, please execute `run-web.sh`

### The `npm` way

- If it's the first time you've cloned this repository onto your machine, please open a terminal and `npm i`
- To start the server, please `node server.js`
- To start the web front-end, please `npm start`

In both cases, if all goes well, at this point you'd be re-directed to your default browser.
